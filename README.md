Hobble for Android

Hobble is a native mobile application for Android that allows users to find someone to walk home with. The idea behind Hobble is that if you are out by yourself, whether you lost your friends or want to leave them, you can find same-gender friends and neighbors in the immediate area, anonymously, to walk home with. The user can send out anonymous requests to these people to go home, which the receiver can accept or deny. If the receiver accepts the request, then the two users are put into a chatroom, where they can decide where to meet up (preferrably in a public area, like the front of a library/house/bar) and walk home together.

Also note:

This is my first project using GitHub. The project's start date is 1/20/14, at MHacks III in Detroit. Hobble is nearing completion, so much of the code in first-commit is already done.

Enjoy!
